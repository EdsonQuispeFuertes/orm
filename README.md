# orm

ORM (Object Relational Mapping). Some of you will already know what they are but, for those who do not know them, an ORM allows you to convert the data of your objects in a correct format to be able to save the information in a database (mapping) creating a virtual database where the data found in our application is linked to the database (persistence).


This ORM allows connections to mysql and oracle databases, and the following commands can be performed:

- Insert: Insert an object into the database.
- Select: Select an object in the database, all the object in the database or a select all with where condition.
- Update: Update an object into the database.
- Delete: Update an object into the database or delete an object with where condition.
